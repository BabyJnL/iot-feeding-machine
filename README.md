# IoT Feeding Machine for Garuda Hacks 5.0
The IoT Feeding Machine is an innovative project that automates the feeding of farmed fish and pets using an Android application developed in Kotlin. The application communicates with an MQTT broker hosted on a VPS, allowing users to control the feeding schedule remotely. An important feature of this device is the integrated weight sensor, which accurately measures the amount of food dispensed when the tube is opened.

IoT devices included:
- ESP32
- Micro Servo Motor
- Load Cell
- MHX711 Module
